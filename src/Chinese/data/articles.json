      "text": "We started with scallion pancakes and dumplings. Both were fantastic. Both were extremely delicious with just the right amount of crunch. I loved my Singapore noodles - so flavorful and filled with veggies and a combination of meats. My son couldn't stop eating his beef brisket noodle soup - so much flavor thanks to the broth and fried garlic. My son enjoyed his Zheng Cafe Seattle style egg foo young over rice. And my hubby enjoyed his ribeye steak with black pepper sauce. We also enjoyed the complimentary dessert.      ",
