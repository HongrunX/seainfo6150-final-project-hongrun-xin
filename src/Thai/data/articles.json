Some of the best Thai food in Seattle without a doubt and also an extensive menu of items I haven't seen in other Thai restaurants. If you enjoy trying new foods this should be high on the list. Everything we ordered came out really good and legitimately super spicy. Service was excellent as well. Overall I highly recommend this if you are looking for good Thai food in the city! ",

Spice rating 5. The veggies and chicken were cooked optimally. Loved the shrooms. Portion size was good enough for the price. Courteous staff. Overall a good place to eat!",
