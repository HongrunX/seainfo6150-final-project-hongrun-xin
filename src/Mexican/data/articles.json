The plates are big, beans are properly seasoned, rice cooked properly and nothing too fancy. It's a big Seahawks bar too and they do karaoke night!",

      "text": "Normally I'd give this place three stars, but the service was so incredible I had to give it four. Much like other reviews, I'd say the food was good but not great. My husband really liked his burrito but found it to be small. I had the fajitas. I wasn't expecting wet meaning sauced meat based on the menu but I gave it a try. It was all right. The place has a ton of character with writing on almost every inch of every wall. They were clean and convenient. We stopped here while walking to Seattle Center from the aquarium. There was no wait and a good amount of seating.",

      "text": "Rice was dry and crunchy. Tacos were cold even after she heated them. Service is non existent they make your taco you pay and they are done with you. They could easily check on you as you are dinning to see how things are going. Prices are over priced and food has no flavor. Steak is a joke it is grounded up steak that looks like it was just thrown in water and made back into meat from powder. Would not reccomend this place. Due to price and service.",
